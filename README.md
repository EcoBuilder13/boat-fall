# Boat Fall
![build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/EcoBuilder13/boat-fall/Actions?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)

This mod is a port of a fix from [RandomPatches](https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches) for [MC-98160](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-98160) and [MC-105103](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105103). The mod works entirely server side while still functioning on the client. With this mod installed boats will break when they fall from a great enough height and their passengers will take the appropriate amount of fall damage. Boats with chests will drop their inventory on the ground when destroyed by fall damage.



## FAQ

- Does this work on my client?

    - Yes, it will fix the bugs on the integrated server, but is not needed when connected to servers as the mod can function entirely server side.

- Can you port to Forge?

    - No, read the [notice](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader).
- Can you port to another version?

    - I will only port to newer versions of the game. All releases have their version limited to all minor releases of the current major version when released.
